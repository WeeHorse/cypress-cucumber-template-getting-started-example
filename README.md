# cypress-cucumber-template-getting-started-example

This example uses Gherkin/Cucumber in Cypress, and performs a google search.

It uses Cypress 10.7 which is an older version, but newer versions cause problems with cucumber, and until we have a better cucumber implementation, we stay with this version, which has proven to still work well, as late as with NodeJS v22, in 2024.
